END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) governs your use of EScribe, Device Monitor, Theme Designer, and other accompanying software (collectively, the “EScribe Suite”), as well as the ECigStats and ECigStats.org (https://www.ecigstats.org/) online software service (“ECigStats,” and together with the EScribe Suite, hereinafter referred to as the “Software”) that you may install on your personal computer for use with your e-vapor controller board(s) and/or device(s) (the “Evolv Product(s)”).  Software and firmware Service Packs may also be made available for your Evolv Products from time to time for you to install.  Evolv Products are manufactured by Dimension Engineering LLC (“Dimension”) in coordination with Evolv LLC (“Evolv,” and together with Dimension, hereinafter referred to as the “Companies”), which owns all of the patents, copyrights, brands and other non-product specific intellectual property related to the Evolv Products.  By installing and/or using the Software, you agree to the terms of this EULA.     

As described in Section 2 (“Data Collection”) the Software may automatically collect and/or store data relating to the use of your Evolv Product (the “Collectable Data”, defined below).  When you plug your Evolv Product into a personal computer running the ECigStats software service, the default EScribe Suite installation permits the automatic upload of certain of the Collectable Data (the “Uploadable Data,” defined below) onto ECigStats.org, where it may be synchronized to compile aggregate and/or individual user statistics and to collect scientific data as determined by the Companies.  Users may opt out of data collection by not installing the ECigStats software on their personal computers, or by configuring the Software and/or their e-vapor device to block data collection.  

EScribe Suite also communicates with Evolv online services (https://www.evolvapor.com/) to check for Service Packs, skins, and screens, enable users to retrieve quality and traceability information about their device, restore the device to manufacturer or other settings, update firmware, and perform functions necessary or requested by the user.  The ECigStats.org online service and Evolv online service are collectively referred to herein as the “Services.” Evolv may collect certain personal information from you when you use the Services.  Our information collection, use, and sharing practices are described in more detail below and in our separate Privacy Policy .  By installing the Software and using the Evolv Products and Services, you acknowledge you have read and understand this agreement, and agree to the terms herein. Your use of the Services is also governed by our separate Terms and Conditions , and your purchase and use of any Evolv Products is governed by our separate Evolv Limited Product Warranty .     

YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE OF THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE WITH THE CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this EULA will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of this EULA may not apply to you.

1. License.
Subject to the terms of this EULA, the Companies grant you a limited, non-exclusive license, non-transferable, revocable license (with no right to sublicense) to download and/or update as many copies as you want of the Software, solely for use with Evolv Products. You agree not to, and to not permit others to, (a) license, sell, rent, lease, assign, outsource, or disclose the Software or make the Software available to any third party, (b) remove or alter any trademarks, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the Software, or (c) modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Software. 

2. Data Collection.
Collectable Data includes, but is not limited to (1) data automatically recorded by the device such as the statistical data associated with each puff of an e-vapor device made with an Evolv Product such as date, time, duration, temperature, energy, ambient temperature, resistance, draw volume, orientation, and other sensor and device parameter information, as determined by the Companies; (2) certain technical information relating to the Evolv Product, including the serial number; (3) GeoIP data of the computer terminal from which a connected Evolv Product uploads the Uploadable Data onto ECigStats.org; and (4) certain personal information from you if you use the Services and create an account, such as your e-mail address and a password that you create.  If you create an online account, the personal information you provide will be associated with your individual device data.

Uploadable Data is certain non-personal Collectable Data as determined by the Companies.  When you plug your Evolv Product into a personal computer running the ECigStats software, the default EScribe Suite installation permits the automatic uploading of Uploadable Data, onto ECigStats.org, where it may be synchronized to compile aggregate and/or individual user statistics and to collect scientific data.  Users may opt out of data collection by not installing the ECigStats software, or by configuring the Software and/or device to block data collection.  

Evolv uses the Collectable Data and Uploadable Data to provide the Services, to initiate and conduct surveys (which users may choose not to participate in) and communicate with users, and for our own research (including clinical research), marketing, and business purposes.  We may share some aggregated statistics derived from the Uploadable Data (which does not contain any information that identifies you personally) publicly through ECigStats.org. We may also share Collectable Data with third parties included, but not limited to, other users, for and non-profit companies, public health organizations, trade associations, and regulatory bodies and government agencies in connection with research and regulatory approvals, including but not limited to Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Evolv Products and e-vapor devices made with Evolv Products.  Any personal information we collect from you that is shared with third parties is done so in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  The Companies maintain no control over how the publicly available aggregate data on ECigStats.org is used by third parties and are not liable for any misuse of such data.  Users of ECigStats.org may view their own individual statistics. 

EScribe Suite also communicates with Evolv online services (https://www.evolvapor.com/) to check for Service Packs, skins, and screens, enable users to retrieve quality and traceability information about their device, restore the device to manufacturer or other settings, update firmware, and perform functions requested by or necessary to perform functions requested by the user.

We may use, copy, modify, or publish your Submissions for any purpose and in any way without further notice or any compensation to you.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE EVOLV PARTIES’ CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO EVOLV IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS (IF ANY).

No waiver by the Companies shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver or failure by the Companies to enforce any provision of this EULA will not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other provision.  The parties are independent contractors.  You acknowledge that the Software contains valuable trade secrets of the Companies and its licensors, and you agree that any actual or threatened breach of Section 1 (License) will cause immediate, irreparable harm to the Companies and its licensors for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.  Section headings are for convenience only, and are not to be used in interpreting this EULA.
